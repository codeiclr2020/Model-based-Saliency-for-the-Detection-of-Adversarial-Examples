Running the code requires Cleverhans. 

We've uploaded the specific code for the white-box attack against CIFAR-10. Please do let us know if you're interested in other experiments and we'll happily uploade those too. 

We uploaded our model checkpoints so facilitate running the code. 
One the checkpoints was too large to upload, so it is compressed- please decompress it before using it.
